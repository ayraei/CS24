1) Stride for memory access to src? What about for dst?

src is stride-SIZE. dist is stride-1.

2) How far apart for addresses to map to different cache blocks but map to the
same cache set?

Each block is 64 bytes, so two addresses must be 64 bytes apart to map to
different blocks but the same cache set. This is because the block offset
in the address is rightmost, so the block offset bits do not need to be
right-shifted when retrieved from the full address.

3) The smallest SIZE value that will result in worst-case cache utilization?

The worst-case cache utilization would be having a cache miss every iteration
of the code. So we want each subsequent stride-SIZE access to map to a
different cache block, so we should set SIZE to at least 64.
