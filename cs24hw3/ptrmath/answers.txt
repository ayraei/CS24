Answers for the "Arrays, Pointer Arithmetic, and Structs" section of CS24 HW3:

1) Specify the value of each byte of the 16-byte region pointed to by p.
0x0 00
0x1 00
0x2 00
0x3 ef
0x4 be
0x5 ad
0x6 de
0x7 00
0x8 00
0x9 00
0xa 00
0xb 00
0xc be
0xd ba
0xe fe
0xf ca

2) Specify the offset and size of each member in the struct.
id is offset by 0, with size 4 bytes.
code is offset by 4 bytes, with size 8 bytes.
next is offset by 12 bytes, with size 4 bytes.

What is the total size of the struct in memory?
16 bytes

How many bytes are unused?
3 bytes are unused to pad the character array 'code'.

3) What value of 'offset' will cause the last two lines of code to write the
same byte?
arr[4] gives us sizeof(entry) * 4 = 64 bytes before the struct we want to
modify. There are 4 more bytes for id, and 3 more bytes for 'code', so to
write the same byte, the offset would have to be 71.
