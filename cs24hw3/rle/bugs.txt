Bug 1. Line 45 in original code.
add     $1, %esi
This is supposed to advance the loop counter to the next 'count', but since
each count is proceeded by a character, we actually need to advance by 2
instead of 1.

Bug 2. Line 78 in original code.
The original code does not increment edi after writing each repeated value,
which is necessary to avoid writing over the same location in memory.

Bug 3. Line 35 in original code.
word-alignment conflicts with the data being given in 1-byte chunks.
