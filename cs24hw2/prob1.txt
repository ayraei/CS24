What does the following assembly code do?

movl    8(%ebp), %eax
imull   $3, %eax
addl    $12, %eax
imull   8(%ebp), %eax
subl    $17, %eax

The code accesses whatever was in M[8 + %ebp], call it x. Then it multiplies
by 3, adds 12, multiplies the resulting value by x, and finally subtracts 17.
Algebraically, the code computes x(3x+12)-17.
