Assume 8(%ebp) contains the address of an object that is a properly
initialized Shape subclass (e.g. a sphere), and we want to invoke the virtual
function getVolume() on this object. Write the IA32 assembly instructions
necessary to do this. Make sure to explain the sequence of operations.

Ignore concerns about caller/callee-save registers, and also ignore how floats
are returned. Just focus on how the method is invoked.
