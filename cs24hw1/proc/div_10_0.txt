10 divided by 0 results in an infinite loop and meaningless results. This is
due to transferring a positive value (dividend = 10) into the remainder
register initially, and performing

remainder = remainder - divisor
10 = 10 - 0 = 10

until remainder goes below 0. However, this will never happen, so the program
as described (and implemented) in the HW writeup will infinite loop.
