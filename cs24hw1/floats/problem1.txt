Practice problem 2.46

A. What is the binary representation of 0.1 - x?

We wish to calculate 0.1 (dec) - 0.00011001100110011001100 (bin)

0.0001100110011001100110011 [0011...] (bin) - 0.00011001100110011001100 (bin)
= 0.0000000000000000000000011[0011...] (bin)

B. What is the approximate decimal value of 0.1 - x?

0.00011001100110011001100 in binary is
0.09999990463256836 in decimal.
0.1 - 0.09999990463256836 = 9.536743164 Ã— 10^-8

C. From 0 to 100 hours, what was the difference between actual time and
computed time?

The counter at 100 hours would have been, in decimal,
100*60*60*10 = 3,600,000 tenth-seconds.
3600000(0.1 - x) = 3600000 * [answer from (b)]
= 0.343322753904 seconds of difference.

D. Predictions are based on velocity and time of last radar detection.
Scud travels 2000 m/s, how far off was the prediction?

(0.343322753904 sec) * (2000 m/sec) = 686.645507808 m difference
